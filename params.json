Often the source files contains large data rows. Testing the flat load from source files to staging table requires one to one row comparison. Extracting the large table into CSV or excel files is challenge because of buffer size and cache limits of database tools. It gets more complicated when there is no unique keys in the data. The developed system resolves this problem and also provides a very flexible set of opportunities to get it done in few seconds.\r\n\r\n# System Requirements\r\nJRE 7 or above\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\n•\tUnzip the downloaded package at your desired directory.\r\n\r\n•\tConfigure the db file available under resources/ directory. (Follow configuration guide given in next topic.)\r\n\r\n•\tOpen command prompt.\r\n\r\n•\tGo to the directory where the package is unzipped.\r\n\r\n•\tRun the command in command prompt: java –jar extractable_v0.1.jar \r\n\r\n•\tYour desired CSV files will be created in your root directory.\r\n\r\n# db properties Configuration Guide\r\n\r\nThe file contains database and other configurations:\r\n\r\n•\tDatabase configuration:\r\n\r\nDB_DRIVER_CLASS=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\r\n\r\nDB_URL=jdbc:mysql://<database-server-ip>:<port>/<database-name>\r\n\r\nDB_USERNAME=<user-name>\r\n\r\nDB_PASSWORD=<password>\r\n\r\n•\tThis is the table you want to extract:\r\n\r\nTABLENAME=<table-name>\r\n\r\n•\tThis is the column name, if you want to split your files on based of some column values.\r\n\r\nCOL=<column-name>\r\n\r\n•\tProvide values (or set of values) for the splitting column.\r\n\r\nGRP1='3','4'\r\n\r\nGRP2='17'\r\n\r\nGRP3=\r\n\r\nGRP4=\r\n\r\n•\tIf you leave all GRP variable blank, one file will be created with all data.\r\n\r\n•\tOtherwise: Files with GRP values will be created,\r\n\r\n•\tOne more file will be created with NOT IN given values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFew notes: \r\n\r\n•\tNo Comma at the end. (eg. ‘1’,’2’,) \r\n\r\n•\tNo blank GRP in between. (eg. GRP1=<blank> GRP=’1’,’2’)\r\n\r\n•\tOne more file will be created with NOT IN given values.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to suggest an improvement. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
